[Impact]

* An explanation of the effects of the bug on users and
* justification for backporting the fix to the stable release.
* In addition, it is helpful, but not required, to include an
   explanation of how the upload fixes this bug.

[Test Case]

* detailed instructions how to reproduce the bug
* these should allow someone who is not familiar with the affected
   package to reproduce the bug and verify that the updated package fixes
   the problem.

[Regression Potential]

* discussion of how regressions are most likely to manifest as a result of this change.
* It is assumed that any SRU candidate patch is well-tested before
   upload and has a low overall risk of regression, but it's important
   to make the effort to think about what ''could'' happen in the
   event of a regression.
* This both shows the SRU team that the risks have been considered,
   and provides guidance to testers in regression-testing the SRU.

[Other Info]

* Anything else you think is useful to include
* Anticipate questions from users, SRU, +1 maintenance, security teams and the Technical Board
* and address these questions in advance
