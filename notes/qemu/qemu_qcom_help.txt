drive_backup [-n] [-f] [-c] device target [format] -- initiates a point-in-time

                        copied to the new image file, excluding data that
                        is written after the command is started.
                        The -n flag requests QEMU to reuse the image found
                        in new-image-file, instead of recreating it from scratch.
                        The -f flag requests QEMU to copy the whole disk,
